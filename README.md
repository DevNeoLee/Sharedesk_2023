## Motivation

This application aims at a web product which serve local community by hosting your private home/office for public work space and share with community around the world in any city. It started with the fact that we have a lack of public space for work and study in local community because of COVID pandemic 2020.

Inspired by WeWork and Air B&B.

User can sign up their home/office space for rental business. Customers can search their local area for available shared work spots near by.
